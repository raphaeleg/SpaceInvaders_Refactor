Visit [my report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B57MS-n-5ULTBAXZg9rvhVzbp5u3qYiJQmF231zRk-c/edit?usp=sharing) as documentation on what I've refactored and the motivations behind it.

Using Visual Studio 2022, with C++ Core Check Rules warnings, it compiles and builds successfully. The compiler reports 0 Warnings, 0 Errors, and 0 Messages.
